# GJK implementation in Numpy
My try at GJK collision detection algorithm created in Numpy

If you do not already know what is collision detection, what is and how GJK approach to it works you should check these links:

# Author's notes

I would like to emphasise that as much as python is made for working with many points of data kind of containers
it was not a swift and elegant thing to create in the slightest...
and even in form I uploaded it is crude enough to break apart with a slight edit
**PROCEED WITH CAUTION**
